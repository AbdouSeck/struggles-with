I am a database developer with experience in web development. I write ETL processes that make use of a wide array of technologies ranging from single server jobs to distributed systems. I am fairly experienced with Oracle and PostGres, and, once upon a time, used SQL Server and MySQL.

I am a huge fan of GCP's `BigQuery` and `Storage` products. I also find `Cloud Functions`, `Pub/Sub` and `Dataflow` instrumental in stitching together realtime data warehouses.

I mostly write in `Python`, `Bash` and `Perl`, but I will occasionally write some `Rust`, `Go` and `C`. I have dabbled with `Haskell` in order to get into functional programming, but I would not deem those adventures successful at all. That's not to say that I am not going to try again whenever time allows. However, in the meantime, I will employ many of the awesome functional programming language features--like `partial application`, `currying`, `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, etc.--via the not-so-functional programming languages mentioned earlier.

As far as web development goes, I use the `Flask` framework on most of my projects. Much of the front-end work I do uses a combination of `Bootstrap`, `JQuery` and `Vanilla JS`. My favorite type of web dev architecture is one where most of the content is generated statically, while the remaining relies on browser APIs like `Fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest` to get fetched. This opens up a lot of opportunities for backend implementations, including using serverless types of technologies. I believe this is what some people have decided to dub `JAMSTACK`. I could be wrong, though.

I also sometimes contribute to open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/AbdouSeck).

While I am not the most social person online, I do keep up with some handles on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/djily02016). Feel free to follow me there, just in case some magical forces compel me to tweet.
